# Week 6 questions answered:

### 1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
Statistical significance is assessed by calculating the p-value, which indicates the probability of observing the results under the null hypothesis. A common threshold for significance is set at 0.05, meaning that if the p-value is less than this threshold, the null hypothesis can be rejected, suggesting that the observed effect is statistically significant.

### 2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the population's original distribution. This is important because it allows for the use of normal probability techniques in statistical inference, enabling researchers to make conclusions about population parameters based on sample data.

### 3. What is the statistical power?
Statistical power is the probability that a statistical test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis. It reflects the test's ability to detect an effect when there is one. Higher power is achieved through larger sample sizes, larger effect sizes, and lower variability in the data.

### 4. How do you control for biases?
Biases can be controlled through various methods, including randomization (to ensure equal group assignment), blinding (to prevent expectations from influencing results), standardization (to maintain consistent protocols), and statistical controls (to adjust for known confounding variables).

### 5. What are confounding variables?
Confounding variables are extraneous factors that correlate with both the independent and dependent variables, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about the relationship between them. They can obscure the true effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable.

### 6. What is A/B testing?
A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a variable (A and B) to determine which one performs better. It involves random assignment of participants to either version and measuring outcomes to assess which version yields superior results.

### 7. What are confidence intervals?
Confidence intervals are a range of values that estimate a population parameter with a specified level of confidence, typically 95%. They provide an interval within which the true parameter is expected to lie, based on sample data, and are useful for understanding the precision of the estimate.
